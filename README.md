# What I Learned In Week 1 at Code Immersives

sdf
### Introduction

You're going to use this repository to document what you learned in Week 1. This won't be a simple list, though--you're going to have to dive a little deeper and explain each concept to a layperson. Specifically, you'll explain the concept to yourself from the previous week!

This is a great way to:
* Review the concepts.
* Learn by teaching.
* And practice your content creation skills.


### How Deep You Should Go

You're NOT writing a manual, here. It doesn't have to be as detailed as a cheatsheet! More specifically, you can talk about things in plain English.

Explain it to your self from before you started. That student from a week ago didn't have the underlying knowledge to know what `bash` or `git` or markdown are, which means you'll have to explain things GENERALLY, avoiding specific terminology whenever possible.

Don't worry too much about the format overall, though. This is our first time, and we'll converge on a common style for this as we go!


### Tools You'll Practice

* bash
* git
* markdown


### Directions

What did we go through this week? You tell me!

1. Create a NEW GitHub repository on their website, making _sure_ not to check the "initialize this repository with a README" option. Call it `what-i-learned-in-week-1` (kebab case!).
2. Clone that repository down.
3. `cd` into that directory and open the file `README.md` in Code.
4. Use markdown to explain one concept to yourself from last week.
5. Once you're done, be SURE to be in the `what-i-learned-in-week-1` directory, and `add`, `commit`, and `push`. Because we cloned down our repo, it's already linked to GitHub's remote, so you don't have to do anything fancy!
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you've covered everything we've learned since Tuesday!
